Given a list of numbers $$ n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_k $$ output a list of numbers
containing for each position $$ 0 <= i <= k $$ the product:

$$ \prod_{j\neq i} n_j $$

For example, given the list $$ [1, 2, 3, 4] $$, output $$ [24, 12, 8, 6] $$.

The problem also asks "Follow-up: what if you can't use division?" which seems
more like a hint than an extra challenge.

This code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/PedestalNix/polyglot/tree/master/daily-coding-problem/problem-002).

# Python

The obvious optimization here is to take the product of all the numbers, and
then divide by the number at each position to get the answer. However, this will
fail if one of the numbers is zero, so we must work around it.

```python
import functools
from operator import mul

def solution(numbers):
    product = functools.reduce(mul, numbers)
    return [product//numbers[i] if numbers[i] != 0
                               else functools.reduce(mul, numbers[:i] + numbers[i+1:])
                               for i in range(len(numbers))]

def solution_beta(numbers):
    return [functools.reduce(mul, numbers[:i] + numbers[i+1:]) for i in range(len(numbers))]
```

Very straightforward. Notice the integer division: without that, the function
will fail for large inputs.

`solution_beta` is much, much slower on large inputs, though. You could probably
optimize it by doing something like computing the product of the left half, then
using that when computing the output of the right half, and vice-versa, thus
cutting the number of multiplications in half. And why stop there? This sounds
like a job for recursion...

# Common Lisp

```common-lisp
(defun solution (numbers)
  (let ((product (reduce #'* numbers))
    (result ()))
    (dotimes (i (length numbers))
      (if (/= (elt numbers i) 0)
      (push (/ product (elt numbers i)) result)
      (push
       (* (reduce #'* (subseq numbers 0 i))
          (reduce #'* (subseq numbers (+ i 1))))
       numbers)))
    (nreverse result)))
```

That's basically the same as the first python solution. How about a recursive
solution?

```common-lisp
(defun recursive-solution (numbers &optional (factor 1))
  (cond ((= (length numbers) 1)
     (list factor))
    (t
     (let* ((half (truncate (/ (length numbers) 2)))
           (left (subseq numbers 0 half))
           (right (subseq numbers half)))
       (append
        (recursive-solution left (* factor (reduce #'* right)))
        (recursive-solution right (* factor (reduce #'* left)))))))
```

How does the performance compare? We'll test with `*nums*` set to
`(1 2 ... 20000)`.

```
CL-USER>  (time (solution *nums*))
Evaluation took:
  7.018 seconds of real time
  7.015625 seconds of total run time (6.296875 user, 0.718750 system)
  [ Run times consist of 1.891 seconds GC time, and 5.125 seconds non-GC time. ]
  99.97% CPU
  23,846,468,706 processor cycles
  1,589,692,160 bytes consed

CL-USER>  (time (recursive-solution *nums*))
Evaluation took:
  2.505 seconds of real time
  2.468750 seconds of total run time (1.609375 user, 0.859375 system)
  [ Run times consist of 1.626 seconds GC time, and 0.843 seconds non-GC time. ]
  98.56% CPU
  8,514,268,764 processor cycles
  1,609,491,984 bytes consed
```

The recursive solution is quite a bit better! The difference becomes more
pronounced as the inputs get larger.

The performance of this recursive, no-divide solution is just about the same as
the first python solution:

```
>>> timeit.timeit("solution(ns)", "from problem_002 import solution; ns=list(range(1,20000))", number=1)
2.309609000105411
```
